        Data format: 
            len(Nrows): equal to the number of subhalos at the corresponding snapshot
            columns : provide the results of two different matching algorithms
                      Each array gives integer indices, whose value is the corresponding index of the matched subhalo 
        
            key = 'SubhaloIndexDark_LHaloTree' -- based on the LHaloTree matching algorithm
                The matching is bidirectional, i.e. TNG <-> DMO. In each base, the best subhalo candidate is chosen as that with the largest number of matching DM particles (Î±=0). Only if the candidate in each direction agrees (bijective), then these matches are saved.
            
            key = 'SubhaloIndexDark_SubLink' -- based on the SubLink weighting algorithm
                The direction of the matching is TNG -> DMO, i.e. for each subhalo in the baryonic physics box a best match is found in the DMO run.
